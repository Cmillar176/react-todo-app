# React: To Do List

## Introduction
This repository demonstrates a simple to do list built using React and FluxThis.
The tooling around the application is quite robust. It uses `webpack` to bundle
application code, JSX syntax and SCSS styles. Babel compiles ES2015 code into
ES5 and it also compiles JSX back into `React.createElement` calls. Assets are
served by `webpack-dev-server`.

## Installation and Usage
The entire project can be built via NPM scripts. Simply install the dependencies
then start the server and visit http://localhost:4321 to view:

    npm install && npm start

To see a full list of available NPM scripts, use the following command:

    npm run
